Research is fucked.



**Experiments**

1. **Textbook example:** Use VDGMM to infer number of clusters with 0% contamination, all common abundances available, all available cluster members for N random clusters (try from 1 to $$ N_max $$). In each MC, draw from abundance uncertainties.
2. **How many abundances do we need?** Same as #1 but throw away some abundances (e.g., a nucleosynthetic pathway or two).
3. **How many cluster members do we need?** Same as #1 but set a (minimum, maximum) range of stars per cluster.
4. **What happens when we increase the contaminating fraction?** Same as #1 but at stages of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90% of field contamination.
5. **What's a realistic scenario?** Make DECISIONS.
